        <p>
            Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects
            of sports, occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper
            nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest along with a formal recovery plan.

        <h2> Strength Training</h2>
        <p>
            Building muscle matters. In fact, your strength and muscle health are leading factors in longevity,
            according to July 2020 research in BMJ.

            That's because doing activities that strengthen and build lean, active muscle can help reduce the risk of
            chronic disease, improve mobility and function and protect brain health.

            For some people, strength training is as simple as lifting their kids or taking the stairs. For others, it's
            about tire flips and mountain climbs.

            That said, whatever your strength and muscle goals are, there are multiple ways to go about meeting them.

        <h2>Aerobic Training</h2>
        <p>
            When you're doing this type of exercise, your body uses your aerobic energy system for power. And, because
            that metabolic system uses oxygen to help create energy, your breathing rate increases, Bernard explains.It
            doesn't matter all that much what you do, as long as you do it regularly. The Centers for Disease Control
            and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise
            each week.

        <h2>Flexibility and Mobility Training</h2>
        <p>
            Possibly one of the most important types of fitness training is flexibility and mobility. Flexibility is the
            ability of your muscles to stretch. Mobility is being able to move your joints and tissues through their
            full range of motion, according to the American College of Sports Medicine.

            Both are important to athletic performance and for avoiding injury. Muscles and joints that are flexible and
            mobile — as well as strong — are much less susceptible to sprains and other injuries.

            Regularly working on flexibility and mobility will also help you age better. You'll be able to move more
            freely, do more of your favorite activities without pain or injury and you'll be able to stay independent
            longer.
